# restaurant-project
Hello, there! This is the landing-page project that's is built as the part of #100Devs learning. The initial process is to do an implementation only HTML & CSS, learning the layout and also the color.
But, along the way, I add some JavaScript because I feel like it is cool to have interactivity on the website.
The project is based on <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/12927498-Cuisine-Restaurant-Website">Design</a> by Mitun Ray. I thank him for his dedication in putting effort designing.
